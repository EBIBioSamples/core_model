/**
 * <p>An experimental workflow graph node. This may be things like Biomaterial, Processing/ProtocolApplication etc.
 * A node in the core model is essentially something able to tell provenance information, i.e. upstream/downstream 
 * nodes. The core model supports two different approaches to track provenance in bimedical experiments: 
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>One is simplified, only experimental {@link Product} are represented, together with information about how they
 *   are derived each other, via the {@link Product#getDerivedFrom() derived relation}.</li> 
 *   <li>The other is more detailed and gives account of the processes that allowed to achieve an experimental product 
 *   from another one. This is done via the concept of {@link Process}, which sits between two (or many) proucts.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Look at lower levels of the hierarchy for more information about the two different approaches. Note that while mixing the 
 * two approaches is technically feasible, we have not designed this model with this scenario in mind (i.e., you'll need
 * some testing).</p>
 *
 * <p>U and D are the type of nodes accepted by the current one as upstream nodes (which the node is derived from) and 
 * downstream nodes (which derives from the current node). More specific subclasses of this bind these generic types 
 * to suitable classes.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that that these properties are {@link Transient} wrt JPA, we cannot easily manage a polymorphic ORM for it. 
 * This (unfortunately) implies that it won't be available in HQL or similar OQ languages. You will have to use the 
 * specific properties in them.</p> 
 *

 * @author Marco Brandizi. This is roughly equivalent to GraphElement in the original AE2 model.
 * 
 * TODO: null nodes validation. They should never be used.
