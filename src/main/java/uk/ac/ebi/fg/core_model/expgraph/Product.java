/**
 * 
 * <p>An experimental product is some initial entity used to perform a biomedical experiment, or some final outcome, such as a
 * data file, or some intermediate entitiy, such as a microarray hybridization output or a treated sample.</p>
 * 
 * <p>As explained in {@link Node}, a Product can be related to other products it derives from (or produces), either by 
 * a direct '{@link #getDerivedFrom() derived}' relation, or through the {@link Process} that determined such derivation.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>PLEASE NOTE</b>: This means the 'derived' relation is new and different than upstream/downstream nodes and processes. 
 * In particular, when you make a product to derive from a process that has certain inputs, these inputs implicitly 'derives into' the
 * product. However we don't manage this implicit relation at all, cause it is too complicated and often not really useful. Concerning this
 * we just provide an '{@link #getAllDerivedFrom() all derived}' relation, which makes this type of inference (but it produces 
 * a copy, it's not a dynamic view).</p> 
 *
 * <p>EP is used to mark the type of property values a node can be associated to (e.g, bio-characteristics, data properties).</p>
 * 
 * <p>Product is mapped with {@link InheritanceType#SINGLE_TABLE} strategy, because: 1) TABLE_PER_CLASS makes it very
 * difficult to deal with the Java Generics used in several subclasses and 2) JOINED at the moment generates secondary
 * tables that are almost empty, being the attribute sets for the various subclasses very similar.</p>
