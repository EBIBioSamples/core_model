/**
 * 
 * <p>A biological material, such as a blood sample, a cell culture, a mouse, a group of patients, a biological extract.
 * This class may have specialisations like bio-source or sample in specific extensions of the core model. Note that
 * the core model aim at representing those materials that have a direct role in the experiment, i.e., are the entities 
 * that are studied. For instance, reagents should not fall under this category.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This class is kept with the EP generic, since there are extensions that need to store heterogeneous properties 
 * (e.g., bio-characteristics + non-bio properties like comments or provider).</p>
